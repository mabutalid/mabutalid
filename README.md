# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marco Theo

### About Me
I enjoy building web applications and the whole process of building it.
I enjoy learning different kinds of technologies as it amazes me on how
it can build applications and making integrations smoother. I'm always trying new things out especially now a days where new technologies are emerging.
